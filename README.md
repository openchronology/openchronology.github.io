# OpenChronology

[![License: AGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0)

A web application for creating and sharing timelines.


## Usage

Everything should work out-of-the-box; you should only need to view `index.html` in a modern browser
to access the application. If you're also interested in offline use, there is a bundled
`openchronology-static.zip` file that has everything needed to run the app locally,
with no external dependencies.


## Build from Source

If you would like to compile the project from source, please read the
[Technical Specification](https://github.com/openchronology/openchronology.github.io/wiki/Technical-Specification) in the Wiki.
